# This is a yml file in which we provide descriptions for both models and columns.
# You can see how we also apply doc blocks (https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/documentation#using-docs-blocks) to 
# write descriptions in one place (via a md file) and apply them through the project.
# We have also applied tests to every primary key listed in this file.
